## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs a full-scale business intelligence analysis on **Blinkit's grocery sales data** — one of India's leading quick-commerce platforms. The goal is to move beyond surface-level stats and extract **actionable, retail-domain insights** using structured SQL analytics and Python-powered visualizations.

The project simulates a real-world data analyst workflow: raw data → database → SQL queries → Python pipeline → charts → business insights.

> Built as part of a Data Science & Analytics internship application at **Celebal Technologies**, demonstrating enterprise-grade analytics thinking.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1. Sales by Outlet Type
Supermarket Type1 drives the largest total revenue (~₹1.3Cr), reflecting its scale advantage. However, Supermarket Type3 leads in average sales per transaction (~₹3,700), indicating a premium customer base with higher basket sizes.

**Business Implication:** Scale up Type1 for volume growth; invest in Type3 for profitability per transaction.

---

### 2. Top Item Types by Revenue
Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods are the highest-grossing categories — each contributing ~15% to total revenue. Household products rank 3rd, revealing strong non-food basket behaviour.

**Business Implication:** Prioritise inventory depth and promotions for these categories to protect revenue base.

![Top Item Types](charts/2_top_item_types.png)

---

### 3. Location Tier Analysis
Tier 3 cities account for 41.1% of total revenue despite being typically underserved markets. Tier 2 contributes 34.8%, while Tier 1 contributes only 24.1%.

**Business Implication:** Tier 3 represents Blinkit's highest-growth opportunity — strong demand exists in smaller cities, making them a strategic expansion priority.

![Sales by Location](charts/3_sales_by_location.png)

---

### 4. Price Bucket Analysis
Premium-priced items (₹150–250 MRP) generate the highest total sales volume. Luxury items (>₹250) command the highest average sale value per transaction (~₹3,850).

**Business Implication:** Premium pricing is the revenue sweet spot — high demand and strong margins. Curate luxury product sections to increase average order value.

---

### 5. Fat Content Analysis
The dataset shows four labels for fat content (Low Fat, LF, Regular, reg) — indicating a **data quality issue** where the same values were entered inconsistently. After normalisation, regular fat products marginally outsell low-fat ones.

**Business Implication:** Customer preference for regular products is slightly dominant. However, the gap is small enough that health-conscious product lines remain commercially viable.

---

### 6. Outlet Establishment Year Trend
Outlets established in 1985 generate the highest total sales (~₹3.6M), with a dip around 1998. Post-2000 outlets show consistent but slightly declining performance.

**Business Implication:** Established outlets have built market trust and loyal customer bases. A sharp 1998 dip likely reflects a single low-performing outlet established that year — not a systemic trend.

---

### 7. Category Revenue Contribution (CTE Analysis)
Using SQL CTEs and cross-join revenue percentage logic, the top 8 categories collectively account for ~80% of total revenue, with Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods holding the top two spots.

**SQL Concepts Used:** CTEs, CROSS JOIN, percentage contribution calculation.

![Category Contribution](charts/7_category_contribution.png)

---

### 8. Outlet Size Performance
Medium-sized outlets lead in total revenue (~₹7.4M), outperforming both Small (~₹4.6M) and High (~₹2.1M) outlets.

**Business Implication:** Medium stores hit the operational sweet spot — enough SKU variety to serve customers without the overhead inefficiency of large-format stores. This has strategic implications for Blinkit's dark store expansion model.

---

### 9. Outlet Performance Benchmarking (Window Functions + CTE)
Using SQL `RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY ...)` and a CTE-based benchmark comparison, 7 out of 10 outlets perform **above** the overall average sales baseline.

**SQL Concepts Used:** Window Functions (RANK, PARTITION BY), CTEs, CASE-based conditional classification.

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Where Used |
|---|---|
| `GROUP BY` + Aggregates | All analyses |
| `CASE` statements | Price bucket segmentation, performance classification |
| CTEs (`WITH` clause) | Revenue contribution, above/below average benchmarking |
| Window Functions (`RANK OVER PARTITION BY`) | Regional outlet ranking |
| `CROSS JOIN` | Revenue percentage calculation |
| Running totals | Cumulative sales by outlet type |
| Subqueries | Nested average benchmarking |

## 📊 Key Business Insights Summary

| # | Insight | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Supermarket Type1 = highest revenue | Volume-first strategy works |
| 2 | Supermarket Type3 = highest avg sale | Premium outlet for profitability |
| 3 | Fruits & Snacks = top 2 categories | Protect these SKUs always |
| 4 | Tier 3 = 41% revenue share | Expand to smaller cities aggressively |
| 5 | Premium pricing = max revenue | Focus on ₹150–250 range products |
| 6 | Medium outlets = top performers | Optimal dark store size confirmed |
| 7 | 70% outlets above average | Healthy network performance |
| 8 | Fat content data has quality issues | Needs standardisation in ingestion |

---

## 🔧 Data Quality Note

The `Item_Fat_Content` column contains inconsistent labels (`Low Fat`, `LF`, `Regular`, `reg`). In a production pipeline, this would be standardised at ingestion time. This has been documented as a finding and can be addressed with:

```python
df['Item_Fat_Content'] = df['Item_Fat_Content'].replace({
    'LF': 'Low Fat', 'low fat': 'Low Fat',
    'reg': 'Regular'
})
```
